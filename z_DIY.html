        <ol>
            <li class="bold">Food</li>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        <li>The First thing one must do when coming to Kansas City is partake in some BBQ; I recommend Joe's Kansas City. Best in the city</li> <br>
                        <li>If you are looking for something more upscale, look no further than the Corvino Supper Culb &amp; Tasting room. In the higher price range, but you won't be disappointed </li> <br>
                        <li> If you love German food, and who doesn't, Try Grunauer. With its rustic feel and great down location, your stomach won't be the only thing impressed.</li> <br>
                        <li>An old family favorite is Buca di Beppo, a family-style Italian restaurant. Nothing is bigger than the plates of pasta you'll get here, nor as tasty</li> <br>
                        <li>If you are willing to venture out of KC, try Swagats, a family-run Indian cuisine staple.</li>
                    </p>
                </ul>
            <li class="bold">Fun</li>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        <li>Let me say nothing is as fun as Worlds Of Fun KC's very own amusement park. Tons of rides, booths, games, and more. If you leave feeling bored, it's your fault! </li> <br>
                        <li>Downtown Kansas City has got to be the busiest, yet quietest, city. This comes from the amazlingly located River market. The farmer's Market is held there every Saturday, but don't worry, it's open every day. With over 20 stores and restaurants, from Board games to Brazilian chicken, if you want, it has it.</li> <br>
                        <li>If Markets aren't your thing, try Ax throwing or even walk the street of the city of fountains</li> <br>
                        <li>Still not impressed what about the over 46 museums</li> <br>
                    </p>
                </ul>
              <li class="bold">Culture</li>
                <ul>
                   <p>
                        <li>As stated above, The C in KC is for Culture. with over 46 museums and exhibitions, you would be hard-pressed to take it all in. First off, you have Union Station with a wide array of circulating exhibits; just look what's in town and go.</li> <br>
                        <li>Or try the Nelson Atkin's Museum of Art, featuring contemporary and modern artists in various mediums. I have spent hours here with family and friends.</li> <br>
                        <li>If History is your fix, boy do we have that, Kc is home to the National WW1 museum, The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, and even I didn't know this but The National Museum of Toys and Miniatures.  </li> <br>
                        <li>As a member, Kansas City is also a great place to visit because it is only 30 minutes from Liberty Jail and a ton of Church sites in Independence</li> <br>
