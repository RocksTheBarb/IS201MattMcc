                            <li>
                                <p>When I was 15 years old, I took a look at my life. I was tired of using others
                                to get what I wanted. So, as all must do when facing independence, we must pursue a job.
                                I began my working life as an assistant at a local construction company and, for the next summer, developed many skills I still use.</p>
                                <p> I learned hard skills like putting up <a class="bold">siding, framing, adding trim, renovating, installing windows, etc.</a> But I also learned invaluable soft skills.
                                    such as <a class="bold">communication with superiors, working long hard hours, time management,</a> and most importantly, <a class="bold">listening</a>.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>This came in handy in school as I graduated high school with over a 4.0 weighted GPA and 4 credit hours of college completed. While in school, <a class="bold">I won 3 art competitions</a> and <a class="bold">created 2 personal courses and curriculums in art</a>.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p> My next job was working at Taco Bell as a kitchen staff. Taking my serious nature of self-improvement further, I quickly learned all the tasks, from making orders to taking them. I never slacked or sat around, which gained the respect of my supervisors. </p>
                                <p>With these skills in <a class="bold">customer service and food prep</a>, I returned after a two-year mission and was quickly trained as a Shift lead. I gained some hard skills like food preparation, but the soft skills are where true growth was. I gained further <a class="bold">team leadership and de-escalation training</a>; I learned how to <a class="bold">manage inventory and banking information</a>, and I acquired some skills to run a successful business.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>I, as a man of faith, felt to put my money where my mouth is and serve a religious mission for my God and my church. This was a two-year-long mission where I was sent wherever the church felt like I was needed. I started in south Utah due to COVID-19 and made many great connections in the business world there. I spent fifteen months all over Saint George, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada before getting sent to Paris, France. While overseas, I had the chance to learn to <a class="bold">read, write, and speak French at a B2 CEFR level.</a> I also <a class="bold">lead teams of missionaries in Belgium in marketing and community outreach!</a> While away from family, I learned to be <a class="bold">self-sufficient, self-motivating, deadline and goal-oriented, and a team player.</a> I learned <a class="bold">interpersonal skills like cold contacts and teaching skills</a>. Even when people didn't want to hear our message, I learned how to befriend them and learn about who they are. As a missionary, I was also tasked with <a class="bold">confidential information handling and was able to pass a visa clearance background check.</a></p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>After coming home, I started college and had to get another job to help pay the bills. This led me down a route of working as an Amazon XL driver for a few months, giving me access to <a class="bold">a commercial license and time management skills</a> as routes were up to me to adjust and plan around.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>I then used Amazon and my driving skills to get a <a class="bold">high-security clearance</a> job as an air
                                    ramp personnel. This involved training as a <a class="bold">Deicer, tug driver, belt load operator and driver, and plane loading.</a> I also worked in the warehouse and gained <a class="bold">6 hours of forklift on-the-job training.</a> I am also <a class="bold">fully certified to perform marshelling on aircraft and ground support equipment.</a></p>
                            </li>
                            <li>I am attending BYU as a pre-business major, having taken a class in information systems that has allowed me to learn VBA, SQL, HTML, CSS, Tableau, and more, which I discuss on the <a href="skills.html">skills page.</a></li>
